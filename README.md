# ERP-College-Attendance-System

In this project, we build an ERP College Attendance System. The system was
made using a Google Firebase. The main objective behind the ERP College Attendance System
is creating a central system while in traditional approach is to do a manual work in paper which
was time consuming and it’s very difficult to manage all the record and also difficult to analyse
the data. With an ERP College Attendance System in place, the attendance will be marked easily.
It also means that manual processes can be automated to free up people’s time and make internal
process more efficient. It’s all about to how to manage the student record in a master file as well
as how admin and faculty can manage the profile and keep information about the student. All the
information about the student and faculty attendance can be seen and edit if necessary.

ERP function involves:
• Manage students and faculty attendance.
• Send leave mails of the faculty.
• Show attendance percentage.
• Gives warning if attendance is less than 50%.
